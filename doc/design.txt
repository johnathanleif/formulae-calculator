iterate over characters in a string to define variables

define a sequence as a series of characters exclusively between endpoints, spaces, and/or operators

define a number as a sequence that contains only numeric characters
define a variable as a sequence starting with an alphabetic character
define a multiplied variable as a number leading a variable

define an operation as the calulation of two variables/numbers about an operator
tranlsate multiplied variables into operations
substitute variables with given numbers
perform operations following order of operations convention
substitute operations for their result until all operations are complete

use eval() to do the calulation (satisfies performing operations) 


remove all spaces from formula string
identify unique variables in formula string
	store variables in a dictionary with list of tuples defining indices of variable start and end in formula string for substitution 
replace multiplied variables with operations
	identify a number sequence until an alphabetic character is found
	split variable into last character of leading number and trailing variable
	replace sequence in formula string with'number*variable' 
request each variable input
replace variables with input in formula string
replace non-python syntax with python syntax for eval() in formula string
do eval() on formula string and display result

build a new string during parse to avoid using replace()
make assumption that inputted formula makes sense and throw errors from eval()
